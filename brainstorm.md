## Ideas
- horde formations on keypress
- doors that are unlocked through matching horde formation with 'key' shape
- visiting cities by "disguising" skeletons in cloaks
- farming simulator for animal corpses
- using HP as resource for spawning skeletons
- skeleton summon radius grows as player holds a key, at a certain threshold, more powerful skeletons are spawned, but if a player gets to 9/10 they will spawn the lower threshhold
- multiplayer: "zombicide" mode where one player spawns the enemies


- rare upgrade that silences paladins??


#### SPELLCASTING BRAINSTORM
- spells cost "living" skeletons to cast, holding the cast will increase its cost and power level
  - should the killed skeletons be entirely random?
  - idle, then attacking?
  - proximity?
- some spells might require a certain threshold and only work if you sacrifice enough skeletons
  - in the event that 2/3 skeletons are sacrificed for a spell and it gets cancelled, no spell effect occurs and the 2 skeletons remain dead
- as skeletons are sacrificed, their "souls" return to the player and fill the cast bar

##### offensive spells:
- force push
- hellfire? 

##### defensive spells:
- shield?
- self heal?

##### buff spells:
- skeleton haste (speed)
- skeleton rage (damage)

##### morph spells:
- summon golem (10 skeletons merge into one mega skeleton)
- spell that kills skeletons and spawns twice as many but for a limited time

## alternative spellcasting concepts
- time based spells (no other costs)
- spells have random negative effects (or specific negative effects based on the spell)


## Peasants merge into mob if there are 10 or more on screen?

## Dopple attacks
- low accuracy, high damage, big aoe strikes?
- knockback
- telegraphed charged


## Other types of skeletons
- at level ~5 choose a type of skeleton to randomly spawn?
- choose a summoning circle spell that WILL summon a specific skeleton (but with a cost)
- "class" based skeletons?
  - druid skeleton turns into skeletal bear
  - rogue skeletons do backstab damage
  - mage skeletons deal damage to player when they attack (something like 0.2)
  - warriors cannot be moved through (obstacles)
  - rangers can hit ally skeletons

  - skeleton lifesteal (minus accuracy)


## boss ideas
- minotaur charges at player and brutally massacres minions, forcing the player to dodge the minotaur attacks with the player and skeletons

- boss that is multiple bosses and they only take damage if they are all being attacked
- boss where you have to sacrifice units to avoid attacks
- group of enemies that you have to break the formation of to get to a powerful enemy
