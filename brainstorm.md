## Ideas
- horde formations on keypress
- doors that are unlocked through matching horde formation with 'key' shape
- visiting cities by "disguising" skeletons in cloaks
- farming simulator for animal corpses
- using HP as resource for spawning skeletons
- skeleton summon radius grows as player holds a key, at a certain threshold, more powerful skeletons are spawned, but if a player gets to 9/10 they will spawn the lower threshhold
- multiplayer: "zombicide" mode where one player spawns the enemies
